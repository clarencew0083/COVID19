### About The Team

The Air Force COVID-19 Health Assessment Dashboard (CHAD) was designed
and developed by Capt James Deitschel, 1st Lt Garrett Alarcon, 2d Lt
Nick Forrest, and 2d Lt Trey Pujats. Each team member received his M.S.
in Operations Research from the Air Force Institute of Technology in
March 2020. They worked in conjuction with HAF/A9 and leveraged the interagency, 
cross-DoD, and whole-of-Air Force Analytic Community collaboration HAF/A9 facilitated.

### What is CHAD?

CHAD was designed to give leaders across the Department of the Air Force
an accessible, centralized location to receive customizable, up-to-date 
COVID-19 information for active duty, national guard, and reserve Air Force Installations. This application is
the result of rapid response efforts to address the escalating fight
against COVID-19. Up-to-date pandemic information automatically updates
daily through various open source datasets listed in the *Sources* info
panel and model projections described in the *Projections* info panel.

### How Can I Use CHAD?

The user can **move across the top tab bar** to receive different
information regarding the national COVID-19 status, the local COVID-19
status, and local situational projections moving forward. All
information displayed updates live with changes in user input facotrs 
defined on the left sidebar.

Users can **adjust various input factors** in the left
sidebar to customize the dashboard experience. Select the Air
Force installation that pertains to you and CHAD will automatically
update with data relating to your installation. Additional inputs can be
defined to customize user experience. However, all additional inputs
have default values. More information about those default values and
the scaling/aggregation approach we use can be found on the *Calculations*
info panel (for the National Summary and Current Local Health tabs) and
the *Projections* info panel (for the Projections tabs)

When using the model projections, it is important to keep in mind that these are based on models with multiple parameters and **subject to considerable uncertainty**.  Additionally, reasonable parameter values will vary locally and over time subject to changes in mitigation behavior (e.g. social distancing) and other factors.  Read more in the *Projections* info panel and reach out to the designated A9 representative for your MAJCOM for additional support and assistance.

**Download a comprehensive report** of the information diplayed on the
dashboard by clicking the *Generate Report* button at the bottom of the
left sidebar.

### Supporting Agencies
Various agencies were involved to launch CHAD. The design and development of CHAD was sponsored by the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), who was critical in ensuring appropriate contacts and collaborations were successful. Special thanks to AF/A9 for support in molding, distributing, and  establishing key connections to move the product to senior leaders. Additional collaboration was conducted with LTC Faber and his team at Army Futures Command in developing model projections.
