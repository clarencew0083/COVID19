# COVID19

The app is hosted on shiny web servers and can be used by following the link here:
https://covid19dash.shinyapps.io/covid19/



The most up to date app is located in the covid19 folder. This folder contains a global.R, server.R, and ui.R file. 
These files contain the most up to date CHAD application. Ensure you have all packages installed and loaded.
We have been using the most up to date version of R for the application. Note we are still updating it daily, so there may be issues. 
If you experience issues, email me at trey.pujats@afit.edu or tpujats@gmail.com and I will send you working code for the app or update the current code.


***** To run the app, go to covid19, download the files, and run the code from the global.R file *****
